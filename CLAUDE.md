# Claude Code Instructions

## Documentation

All architecture documentation is in `.ai/`:

- **README.md** — project overview
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — code structure, database, patterns
- **CONVENTIONS.md** — code style, naming, migrations
- **CONTEXT.md** — AI context and preferences
- **ROADMAP.md** — development plans

**Read these files before starting work.**

## Rules

### D&D 2024 Rules

Verify all D&D 2024 rules with `@dnd-2024` agent before implementation.

### Git Commits

**ALWAYS ask before committing!**

- Never commit automatically after making changes
- First show what changed, then ask "Commit?"
- Wait for explicit confirmation ("yes", "да", "commit")
- Even for small fixes — ask first
